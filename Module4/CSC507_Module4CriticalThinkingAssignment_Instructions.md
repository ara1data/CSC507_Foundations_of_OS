## Simulate the First-Fit Algorithm in Allocating Memory to Processes
In memory management, the First-Fit algorithm allocates the first available memory block that can accommodate a process. Your task is to create a program that simulates the First-Fit algorithm for memory allocation in an operating system using a programming language of your choice. Test your algorithm with varying memory block sizes and process sizes.

In your summary paper, explain how the algorithm works, and compare it with the Best-Fit algorithm. Include screenshots of the source code and the paper for reference. Can you think of situations where the best-fit algorithm is preferable to the first-fit algorithm? Explain your reasons for that opinion.

Your paper should be 2-3 pages and contain at least 3 references.
