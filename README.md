# CSC507 Foundations of Operating Systems

This repository contains notes, programs, and deliverables completed by Alex Reichart-Anderson during the graduate course: CSC505 Foundations of Operating Systems.

## Course Description:
This course will introduce you to the ins and outs of Computer Operating Systems. You will learn how and why operating systems evolved from the simple batch systems in the early days, to the advanced and varied systems we use today. You will understand the essential elements of operating systems, including processors, memory, and file management. This course will use both theory and practical application of the information learned.

## Course Learning Outcomes:
1. Identify the resources and factors that affect computer system performance.
2. Implement techniques to improve parallelism and latency in an application.
3. Contrast the kernel and user mode in developing key approaches to operating system design and implementation.
4. Analyze processes that can be utilized to improve the operating system environment during execution.
5. Use system commands to manage I/O systems and file systems in an operating system environment.
